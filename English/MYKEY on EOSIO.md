# MYKEY on EOSIO


MYKEY is a Self-sovereign Identity System. The
underlying protocol is called KEY ID.

The purpose of this document is to explain the differences between MYKEY account and traditional EOS account.

Meanwhile, document will demonstrate the simple way to make your code compatible with MYKEY App.


## What are the differences on MYKEY?

For improving user experiences and lower the threshold of EOS usage, MYKEY designed to resolve the problem of private key management and resource consumption management base on KEY ID protocol.

More details in [MYKEY Whitepaper](../mykey_whitepaper_en.pdf)

MYKEY re-designed the native EOS account by KEY ID Smart Contract which split two parts on EOS mainnet.

In EOS, MYKEY support features on key recovery, privilege level, free account, free usage, authentication, sub account and so on. For easy understanding, MYKEY try to hide technical concept for end users. In MYKEY App, user needn't care about CPU/NET/RAM of their EOS account.

But at the same time, user's account still keep self-sovereign, users own their own authority. More details will be disclosed in coming documentation and open-source plan.

## MYKEY account structure

There are two types of key in MYKEY account structure: Admin Key and Operation Key.
In SmartContract, Admin Key cannot sign any general transaction except sign transaction to replace Operation Keys with time-lock.

The private key of Admin Key generated by mobile device which can be cold-backup through recovery code or hardware wallet during registration. The private keys of Operation Keys generated and secure stored by mobile device.

The public keys of Admin Key and Operation Keys are used to signup account and stored in SmartContract for further on-chain signature verification.

With those novel design principle, MYKEY can help dApp build their own native dApp without any explicit sign between dApp and 3rd party wallets.
What's more, users can safely manage their asset, vault account, dApp accounts, data by different operation keys which is in one single account, we call it Self-sovereign Identity.
