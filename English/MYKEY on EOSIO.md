# MYKEY on EOSIO


MYKEY is a Self-sovereign Identity System. The
underlying protocol is called KEY ID.

The purpose of this document is to explain the differences between MYKEY account and traditional EOS account.

Meanwhile, document will demonstrate the simple way to make your code compatible with MYKEY App.


## What are the differences on MYKEY?

To improve user experiences and lower the threshold of EOS usage, MYKEY designed to resolve the problem of private key management and resource consumption management based on KEY ID protocol.

More details in [MYKEY Whitepaper](../mykey_whitepaper_en.pdf)

MYKEY has re-designed the native EOS account by KEY ID Smart Contracts that split two parts on EOS mainnet.

- [mykeymanager](https://bloks.io/account/mykeymanager)
- [mykeylogica1](https://bloks.io/account/mykeylogica1)

In EOS, MYKEY supports features like key recovery, privilege level, free account, free usage, authentication, sub account and so on. For easy understanding, MYKEY tries to hide technical concept for end users. In MYKEY App, user do not have to care about CPU/NET/RAM of their EOS account.

But at the same time, user's account still stays self-sovereign, authority belongs to users. More details will be disclosed in coming documentation and open-source plan.

## MYKEY account structure

There are two types of key in MYKEY account structure: Admin Key and Operation Key.
In SmartContract, Admin Key cannot sign any general transaction except sign transaction to replace Operation Keys with time-lock.

The private key of Admin Key generated by mobile device which can be cold-backup through recovery code or hardware wallet during registration. The private keys of Operation Keys generated and secure stored by mobile device.

The public keys of Admin Key and Operation Keys are used to signup account and stored in SmartContract for further on-chain signature verification.

With those novel design principle, MYKEY can help dApp build their own native dApp without any explicit sign between dApp and 3rd party wallets.
What's more, users can safely manage their asset, vault account, dApp accounts, data by different operation keys which is in one single account, we call it Self-sovereign Identity.

## Keys in table `keydata`

Every keys of MYKEY account will be stored in table `keydata` of contract `mykeymanager`, we can use `ACCOUNT_NAME` as scope to query all keys in MYKEY account.

Use following account `mykeyhulu521 ` for example,

[https://eosq.app/account/mykeymanager/tables?sope=mykeyhulu521&tableName=keydata](https://eosq.app/account/mykeymanager/tables?sope=mykeyhulu521&tableName=keydata)

MYKEY predefined four keys for every account during sign up. Details shown in the following table

| Index  |    Use | 
|:---:|---|
|  0 |   AdminKey: Top privilege, can manage other operation keys    |
|  1 |   OperationKey 1/Asset key: only use for transfer assets  |
|  2 |   OperationKey 2/Adding key: For creating more new operation keys |
|  3 |   OperationKey 3/Reserved key: For other actions without specific operation keys  |

## Integrate EOS dApps with MYKEY


### For dApps compatible with Scatter

MYKEY almost compatible with interfaces of Scatter protocol. The only difference from traditional wallet is MYKEY will use one of its Operation Key to sign transactions instead of the EOS owner/active key. 

Any actions of original contacts will be wrapped by MYKEY app, then send to [mykeymanager](https://bloks.io/account/mykeymanager) for verify signature and then forward to the target contracts. In most of cases, anything works correctly without any changes in code. 

#### How to check dApps are running in MYKEY webview

There are two methods to check if dApps are running in MYKEY client.

1. Use `navigator.userAgent` to check. MYKEY webview will append `MYKEY/[version]` after the original userAgent.

```
function isMYKEY(){
	return navigator.userAgent.indexOf("MYKEY") > -1;
}

```

2. Use `scatter.getIdentity` to check if the response data contain `{'type':'mykey'}`


#### If dApps dependent on `getArbitrarySignature` 

For dApps are using method `scatter.getArbitrarySignature` to verify account authority in sever side. The code for verifying signature should be refined.

In this case. MYKEY uses the reserved key which index is 3 to sign through `scatter.getArbitrarySignature`. Server side of dApps need use the corresponding public key of reserved key to verify signature, it can be queried by backend code in table `keydata` of contract `mykeymanager ` by scope `ACCOUNT_NAME`. 

We already implement some code sample for reference. Please check it out.
